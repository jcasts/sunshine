    Sunshine::DeployServer constructors, and attr_accessor :sudo

  * Settler Dependency classes support a default sudo value:
      Sunshine::Dependencies::Gem.sudo = true   # use sudo
      Sunshine::Dependencies::Gem.sudo = "usr"  # use sudo -u usr
      Sunshine::Dependencies::Gem.sudo = false  # ensure sudo is off
      Sunshine::Dependencies::Gem.sudo = nil    # use :call obj precedence

* App supports passing a (yml) file object to the constructor.
  Useful for passing file DATA if desired:
    app = Sunshine::App.new Sunshine::DATA
    app.deploy!{|app| Sunshine::Rainbows.new(app).restart }
    __END__
    #yaml for app goes here...

      /path/to/app/env some_command
      /path/to/app/env EXTRA_VAR=some_value some_command
    Supports all options the env command supports.

* Dependency handling now supports apt.

* DeployServers now support passing custom flags for ssh and rsync:
    deploy_server = DeployServer.new "svr.com", :rsync_flags => [...]

    deploy_server.call "some_command",
      :sudo => "user", :flags => '-C'

    deploy_server.upload "from", "to",
      :sudo => "user", :flags => ['--chmod=ugo=rwX', '-b']

    deploy_server.download "from", "to",
      :flags => '--ignore-existing'

* Repo implementation has significantly changed:

  * Added support for git repo.

  * Info about a repo is now retrieved with Repo#get_repo_info:
      repo.get_repo_info deploy_server, checkout_path

  * Repo constructor supports options hash with :flags option.
