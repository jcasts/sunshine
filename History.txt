=== 0.0.4 / 2010-02-12

* Added sudo functionality:

  * Support for :sudo option on Sunshine::App, Sunshine::Server, and
    Sunshine::DeployServer constructors, and attr_accessor :sudo

* App supports passing a (yml) file object to the constructor.
  Useful for passing file DATA if desired:
    app = Sunshine::App.new Sunshine::DATA
    app.deploy!{|app| Sunshine::Rainbows.new(app).restart }
    __END__
    #yaml for app goes here...

* Changed the format of the App#checkout_path directory

* Changed how the app source gets to the deploy servers:

  * Checks for repo information.

  * Checks out code if necessary.

  * If no repo information is available or if the :source_path app config
    is set uses either the pwd or the set source_path value.

* Commands functionality expanded:

  * Support for --sudo and --sudo=user on all Sunshine commands

  * Added --format option for control commands. Supports txt, yml, json.

* Control scripts generated on the remote server now keep deploy-time
  shell_env variables:

  * Run commands with the --no-env option to run without
    deploy shell_env variables.

  * Run any script with the app's env variables using:
      /path/to/app/env some_command
      /path/to/app/env EXTRA_VAR=some_value some_command
    Supports all options the env command supports.

* Dependency handling now supports apt.

* DeployServers now support passing custom flags for ssh and rsync:
    deploy_server = DeployServer.new "svr.com", :rsync_flags => [...]

    deploy_server.call "some_command",
      :sudo => "user", :flags => '-C'

    deploy_server.upload "from", "to",
      :sudo => "user", :flags => ['--chmod=ugo=rwX', '-b']

    deploy_server.download "from", "to",
      :flags => '--ignore-existing'

* Repo implementation has significantly changed:

  * Added support for git repo.

  * Info about a repo is now retrieved with Repo#get_repo_info:
      repo.get_repo_info deploy_server, checkout_path

  * Repo constructor supports options hash with :flags option.
